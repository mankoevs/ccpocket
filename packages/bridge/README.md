# @ccpocket/bridge

Bridge server that connects Claude sessions powered by the [Claude Agent SDK](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk) and [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) to mobile devices via WebSocket.

This is the server component of [ccpocket](https://github.com/K9i-0/ccpocket) — a mobile client for Claude and Codex.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest
```

A QR code will appear in your terminal. Scan it with the ccpocket mobile app to connect.

> Warning
> Versions older than `1.25.0` are deprecated and should not be used for new installs because current Anthropic Claude Agent SDK docs do not permit third-party products to use Claude subscription login.
> Upgrade to `>=1.25.0` and use `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` instead of OAuth.

## Installation

```bash
# Recommended: run the latest Bridge directly
npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest

# Optional: install globally
npm install -g @ccpocket/bridge
ccpocket-bridge

# Show CLI help or version
ccpocket-bridge --help
ccpocket-bridge --version
```

## Configuration

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `BRIDGE_PORT` | `8765` | WebSocket port |
| `BRIDGE_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `BRIDGE_API_KEY` | (none) | API key authentication (enabled when set) |
| `BRIDGE_ALLOWED_DIRS` | `$HOME` | Comma-separated list of project directories the Bridge may access; set exactly to `*` to allow any directory |
| `BRIDGE_PUBLIC_WS_URL` | (none) | Public `ws://` / `wss://` URL used for startup deep link and QR code |
| `BRIDGE_CODEX_APP_SERVER_MODE` | `private` | Experimental Codex app-server mode: `private`, `managed`, or `external` |
| `BRIDGE_CODEX_SHARED_APP_SERVER_URL` | `ws://127.0.0.1:8767` in `managed` mode | Experimental shared Codex app-server URL for Codex CLI co-presence |
| `BRIDGE_DEMO_MODE` | (none) | Demo mode: hide Tailscale IPs and API key from QR code / logs |
| `BRIDGE_RECORDING` | (none) | Enable session recording for debugging (enabled when set) |
| `BRIDGE_DISABLE_MDNS` | (none) | Disable mDNS auto-discovery advertisement (enabled when set) |
| `BRIDGE_PROMPT_HISTORY_FILE` | `$HOME/.ccpocket/prompt-history-v2.json` | Custom prompt history store path |
| `BRIDGE_RECENT_SESSIONS_PROFILE` | (none) | Log recent-session index timing when set to `1` or `true` |
| `BRIDGE_FILE_LIST_MAX_ENTRIES` | `5000` | Maximum file and directory entries returned to a client; non-positive or invalid values use the default |
| `BRIDGE_FILE_LIST_MAX_BYTES` | `524288` | Maximum serialized path bytes returned in a client file list; non-positive or invalid values use the default |
| `BRIDGE_DELTA_BATCH_MS` | `100` | Milliseconds to batch streaming deltas per connected client; set to `0` to disable batching |
| `BRIDGE_DELTA_BATCH_MAX_CHARS` | `4096` | Maximum Unicode characters per batched streaming payload; non-positive or invalid values use the default |
| `DIFF_IMAGE_AUTO_DISPLAY_KB` | `1024` (1 MB) | Auto-display diff images up to this size, in KB |
| `DIFF_IMAGE_MAX_SIZE_MB` | `5` (5 MB) | Maximum diff image size available for on-demand loading, in MB |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | (none) | Claude Agent SDK API key used for Claude sessions |
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | (none) | Advanced Claude SDK auth token; prefer `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | (none) | Codex API key; Codex can also use `~/.codex/auth.json` |
| `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY` | (none) | Proxy for outgoing fetch requests (`http://`, `https://`, `socks4://`, `socks5://`) |

Lowercase proxy variables (`https_proxy`, `http_proxy`, `all_proxy`) are also
supported. When `BRIDGE_PROMPT_HISTORY_FILE` is not set and `BRIDGE_PORT` is not
`8765`, prompt history is stored in
`$HOME/.ccpocket/prompt-history-v2-<port>.json`.

Push relay uses Firebase Anonymous Auth automatically; no FCM environment
variables are required.

```bash
# Example: custom port with API key
BRIDGE_PORT=9000 BRIDGE_API_KEY=my-secret npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest

# Example: allow projects outside $HOME
BRIDGE_ALLOWED_DIRS="$HOME,/scratch/$USER" npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest

# Example: expose Bridge through a reverse proxy / ngrok
BRIDGE_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://example.ngrok-free.app npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest

# Example: same setting via CLI flag
ccpocket-bridge --public-ws-url wss://example.ngrok-free.app

# Example: disable mDNS advertisement
BRIDGE_DISABLE_MDNS=1 npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest
# or via CLI flag
ccpocket-bridge --no-mdns
```

When `BRIDGE_PUBLIC_WS_URL` is set, the startup deep link and terminal QR code
use that public URL instead of the LAN address. This is useful when the Bridge
is reachable through a reverse proxy, tunnel, or public domain.

Without it, the printed QR code is LAN-oriented by default and typically encodes
something like `ws://192.168.x.x:8765`.

## Persistent service setup

Register the Bridge as a user-level background service:

```bash
npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest setup
```

Setup supports macOS launchd and Linux systemd. It persists the Bridge settings
that affect startup:

- `BRIDGE_PORT` / `--port`
- `BRIDGE_HOST` / `--host`
- `BRIDGE_API_KEY` / `--api-key`
- `BRIDGE_ALLOWED_DIRS`
- `BRIDGE_PUBLIC_WS_URL` / `--public-ws-url`
- `BRIDGE_DISABLE_MDNS` / `--no-mdns`
- `BRIDGE_CODEX_APP_SERVER_MODE` / `--codex-app-server-mode`
- `BRIDGE_CODEX_SHARED_APP_SERVER_URL` / `--codex-shared-app-server-url`

### Connect from anywhere without a phone-wide VPN

On a Mac or Linux host already signed in to Tailscale, the Bridge can expose
itself through [Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel). The
phone connects directly to the resulting public `wss://` endpoint, so the
Tailscale VPN does not need to run on the phone:

```bash
npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest setup-funnel
```

From a source checkout that already contains this command, use:

```bash
npm install
npm run bridge:setup-funnel
```

The command enables Funnel for the Bridge port, generates a persistent API
token when one was not supplied, and registers the Bridge as a background
service with its stable Funnel URL. The token is stored at
`~/.ccpocket/funnel-api-key` with owner-only permissions and is also persisted
in the service configuration. The first run may print a Tailscale approval URL;
open it once, then run the command again.

Funnel makes the endpoint publicly reachable, so API-key authentication is
always enabled by this setup command. Scan the Bridge QR code once in CC Pocket;
the app stores the token in platform-secure storage and reconnects over `wss://`
without a separate VPN app.

Example:

```bash
BRIDGE_ALLOWED_DIRS="$HOME,/scratch/$USER" \
BRIDGE_API_KEY=my-secret \
npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest setup
```

On Linux, setup gives standalone Codex installs priority by including
`$HOME/.local/bin` before npm-managed Node paths in the service `PATH`.

## Experimental: Join a CC Pocket Codex Session from Codex CLI

By default, each Codex session uses a private app-server. To let Codex CLI join
the same live thread that CC Pocket started, run the Bridge with shared
app-server mode:

```bash
BRIDGE_CODEX_APP_SERVER_MODE=managed \
BRIDGE_CODEX_SHARED_APP_SERVER_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8767 \
npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest
```

Then start or resume a Codex session from CC Pocket. When the session is ready,
the session screen can copy a session-specific command like:

```bash
codex resume <thread-id> --remote ws://127.0.0.1:8767
```

Run that command in a terminal on the same machine as the Bridge. The
`127.0.0.1` address is for the Mac/Linux machine running the Bridge and Codex
CLI, not for the phone.

Modes:

- `private`: default behavior. No Codex CLI co-presence.
- `managed`: Bridge starts one local WebSocket Codex app-server and shares it
  with Codex CLI.
- `external`: Bridge connects to an already-running app-server. In this mode,
  `BRIDGE_CODEX_SHARED_APP_SERVER_URL` is required.

This is experimental and currently targets Codex CLI co-presence only. Codex App
compatibility is not guaranteed and may use a different integration model in the
future.

## Requirements

- Node.js v18+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and/or [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)

Current Codex CLI docs recommend the standalone installer for macOS/Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh
```

## Health Check

Run the built-in doctor command to verify your environment:

```bash
npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest doctor
```

It checks Node.js, Git, CLI providers, macOS permissions (Screen Recording, Keychain), network connectivity, and more.

## Architecture

```
Mobile App ←WebSocket→ Bridge Server ←stdio→ Claude Code CLI
```

The bridge server spawns and manages Claude Code CLI processes, translating WebSocket messages to/from the CLI's stdio interface. It supports multiple concurrent sessions.
